# Task 1

- We have an API that returns a list of call invites.
- Edit `pages/index.tsx` to make it fetch call invites and display them as a list.
- Use redux and the existing redux actions and reducers in `store/invites`

# Task 2

- Now we want the page to continuously poll for new invites.
- Edit the page to do that.

# Task 3

- We may want other pages to also be able to poll for new invites.
- Refactor the page to use a custom hook that can be used by other pages.
